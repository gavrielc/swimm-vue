The Lists Pool app created for learning purposes.  The app allows you to create lists (of lists).

The data is saved to the browser [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) (so don't keep any important information).

We used a UI framework called [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com). Vuetify is an open source MIT project for building user interfaces for web and mobile applications. It provides us with many components with material design style ready to use (so we wouldn't need to css everything to look good).
